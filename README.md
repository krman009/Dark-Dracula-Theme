Dark-Dracula-Theme
==================

A Sublime Text (2) color theme. Just Changed background color and lineHighlight color in Dracula Theme (Which is developed by [Zeno Rocha](https://twitter.com/zenorocha "Twitter handle of Zeno Rocha")).

Actually I've made it because I want to use it with `Soda Dark Theme`.
In which, I think more dark background will be better to see, Thus I've changed some colors and applied it.

### Use?
Just choose it from the `Preferences -> Color Scheme` Context Menu.

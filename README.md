Dark-Dracula-Theme
==================

A Sublime Text (2) color theme. Just Changed background color and lineHighlight color in Dracula Theme (Dracula Theme is developed by Zeno Rocha).

> Acutally I've made it because I want to use it with `Soda Dark Theme`. In which, I think more dark background will be cool so changed some colors and applied it.

### How to install it?  
I think you just have to `clone` the repo to the `packages folder` in sublime text.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/krman009/Dark-Dracula-Theme.git
